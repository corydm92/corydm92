  <br />
  I build and own product and platform web systems end to end, with a frontend tilt. I lead architecture, data flow, and UI foundations, and I also ship the Node/API work, tooling, and CI/CD that makes delivery predictable in production.

  Outside of work, you can find me rolling putts at the golf course, wrangling my pets, and exploring the PNW.

### 🧠  What I Do

- 🏗️ **Web Systems Architecture**  
  Define app boundaries, data flow, and integration contracts (UI, API, build) so teams can ship features without chaos

- 🚢 **Delivery & Reliability**  
  CI/CD, release hygiene, production debugging, and observability practices that make changes safe to deploy and easy to recover

- ⚡ **Web Performance**  
  Core Web Vitals, rendering behavior, caching, and bundle strategy (profiling first, then targeted fixes)

- 🎛️ **UI Foundations**  
  Design systems, reusable component libraries, accessibility (WCAG), and tooling that standardizes quality across teams

- 🧭 **Technical Leadership**  
  Drive alignment through ADRs, reviews, and mentoring so decisions stick and execution stays predictable

### 🚀 Primary Focus: Frontend Engineering Blueprint

My main focus lately has been building and refining my Frontend Engineering Blueprint — a 7 layer frontend architecture model where each layer builds on the last, making correctness and stability the default across the SDLC.

This repo represents the most current snapshot of how I think and work:  
systems design, documentation as tooling, and predictable team execution.

I also keep a structured learning log where I track advanced coursework, refreshers, and deep dives (primarily Frontend Masters), treating learning as a repeatable system, not ad-hoc notes.

### 📌 Public Projects I’m Proud Of

Most of my recent work is private (paid work + internal systems), so my public repos skew older — but they still show how I build, document, and automate.

**🧮 Threshold MTG**  
Streamlined MTG pricing updates by turning spreadsheet workflows into repeatable metrics.  
Cut the process from hours to minutes by standardizing inputs and automating comparisons.

Repo → https://github.com/corydm92/threshold-mtg

**🧱 Component Library with Lerna**  
Monorepo component library serving as a single source of truth for shared UI modules.  
Covers library architecture, publishing, and independent package scaling.
