  <br />
  I build and own product and platform web systems end to end, with a frontend tilt. I lead architecture, data flow, and UI foundations, and I also ship the Node/API work, tooling, and CI/CD that makes delivery predictable in production.

  <br />
  Outside of work, you can find me rolling putts at the golf course, wrangling my pets, and exploring the PNW.

### 🧠  What I Do

- 🏗️ **Web Systems Architecture**  
  Define app boundaries, data flow, and integration contracts (UI, API, build) so teams can ship features without chaos

- 🚢 **Delivery & Reliability**  
  CI/CD, release hygiene, production debugging, and observability practices that make changes safe to deploy and easy to recover

- ⚡ **Web Performance**  
  Core Web Vitals, rendering behavior, caching, and bundle strategy (profiling first, then targeted fixes)

- 🎛️ **UI Foundations**  
  Design systems, reusable component libraries, accessibility (WCAG), and tooling that standardizes quality across teams

- 🧭 **Technical Leadership**  
  Drive alignment through ADRs, reviews, and mentoring so decisions stick and execution stays predictable

### 🚀 Primary Focus

**📐 Frontend Engineering Blueprint**  
A 7‑layer frontend architecture system that standardizes correctness, delivery, and documentation at scale.  
Built as a living blueprint for how I design, document, and evolve long‑lived frontend systems.

Repo → https://github.com/corydm92/frontend-engineering-blueprint

**🧰 TypeScript Monorepo Template**  
Apps‑first template with CI orchestration and per‑app quality gates for scaling product + platform work.  
Optimized for fast project bootstrap with clear tooling boundaries and predictable delivery.

Repo → https://github.com/corydm92/github-ts-repo-template

### 📌 Projects I’m Proud Of

These are older projects, but they show how I’ve built, documented, and automated over the years — foundational work that shaped the engineer I am today.

**🧮 Threshold MTG**  
Streamlined MTG pricing updates by turning spreadsheet workflows into repeatable metrics.  
Cut the process from hours to minutes by standardizing inputs and automating comparisons.

Repo → https://github.com/corydm92/threshold-mtg

**🧱 Component Library with Lerna**  
Monorepo component library serving as a single source of truth for shared UI modules.  
Covers library architecture, publishing, and independent package scaling.
