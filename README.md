## Public projects I’m proud of

Most of my recent work is private (paid work + internal systems), but these older repos show how I build and how I think.

### Threshold MTG
Streamlined MTG pricing updates and comparisons by turning spreadsheet workflows into repeatable metrics.  
Cut the process from hours to minutes by standardizing inputs and automating the update + comparison steps.

### Component Library with Lerna
Monorepo component library as a single source of truth for shared UI modules.  
Includes onboarding and hands-on examples for building a library, publishing to an npm registry, and scaling packages independently.

## Now

* Building systems that stay simple as they grow
* Developing a blueprint for structuring scalable, predictable frontend applications, from project initialization to observability and key metrics
* Golf, pets, and the PNW outdoors
