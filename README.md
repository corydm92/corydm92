Most of my recent work is private (paid work + internal systems), but these older repos show how I build and how I think.

### Threshold MTG 🧮
Streamlined MTG pricing updates and comparisons by turning spreadsheet workflows into repeatable metrics.  
Cut the process from hours to minutes by standardizing inputs and automating the update + comparison steps.

### Component Library with Lerna 🧱
Monorepo component library as a single source of truth for shared UI modules.  
Includes onboarding and hands-on examples for building a library, publishing to an npm registry, and scaling packages independently.
