### 🧠  What I Do

- 🏗️ **Frontend Architecture**  
  Language + architecture contracts, app structure, state + data flow, testing strategy, UI systems, build/deploy pipelines, and production observability

- 🧭 **Technical Leadership**  
  Align teams on shared system design, capture decisions through ADRs, and build guardrails (standards, tooling, reviews) so teams move fast without regressions

- ⚡ **Web Performance**  
  Rendering behavior, Core Web Vitals, React Fiber lifecycle & concurrency model, caching strategies, bundle optimization

- 🎛️ **UI Systems**  
  Design systems, reusable component libraries, accessibility (WCAG), quality guardrails

- 🤝 **Team Velocity**  
  Mentorship, PR quality, standards, reducing regressions, raising delivery reliability

### 🚀 Primary Focus: Frontend Engineering Blueprint

My main focus lately has been building and refining my **Frontend Engineering Blueprint** — a 7 layer frontend architecture model where each layer builds on the last, making correctness and stability the default across the SDLC.

This repo represents the most current snapshot of how I think and work:  
systems design, documentation as tooling, and predictable team execution.

Repo → https://github.com/corydm92/frontend-engineering-blueprint

I also keep a structured learning log where I track advanced coursework, refreshers, and deep dives (primarily Frontend Masters), treating learning as a system rather than ad-hoc notes.

### 📌 Public Projects I’m Proud Of

Most of my recent work is private (paid work + internal systems), so my public repos skew older — but they still show how I build, document, and automate.

**🧮 Threshold MTG**  
Streamlined MTG pricing updates by turning spreadsheet workflows into repeatable metrics.  
Cut the process from hours to minutes by standardizing inputs and automating comparisons.

Repo → https://github.com/corydm92/threshold-mtg

**🧱 Component Library with Lerna**  
Monorepo component library serving as a single source of truth for shared UI modules.  
Covers library architecture, publishing, and independent package scaling.
